About 5 hours

## Next Steps

    -Clear styles to better use styled components
    -Cover all functionatlies with tests
    -Design is not pixel perfect
    -Current time function has an issue (it would be necessary to calculate the difference in seconds in the first run to make it syncronize with the device clock)
    -Add proper state management and data fetching for future usage (consider react query)

### Unknown
    -Could not find API contracts wich seems weird because I was not able to schedule the Carer correctly because of that.
