## Time to complete 
About 5 hours


## Next Steps
    -Add some css package (styledComponents)  or at least extract the styles to a different file (had some issues with the correct typings).
    -Cover all functionatlies with tests.
    -Design is not pixel perfect
    -Current time function has an issue (it would be necessary to calculate the difference in seconds in the first run to make it syncronize with the device clock)
    -Add proper state management and data fetching
